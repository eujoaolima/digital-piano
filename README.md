# digital-piano

One of my dreams has always been to have a piano, but neither my parents nor I can afford one.
So... since I'm learning to program, I decided to create a digital piano.

I believe it's a great way to work with what I've learned, and also put into practice new functions in HTML and JS.

It is a simple musical keyboard, it has only one octave, but it shows a great evolution.
